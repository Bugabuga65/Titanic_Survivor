# titanic_death_Prediction
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In this project I have predicted which passenger survived the titanic ship wreck using Logistic regresion.
In order to predict the death of a particular passenger I have used some other standards of correctness which are:  Precision  Recall  F1-score  Support These all standard of correctness are depend upon the Actual and Predict class, so i draw a 2×2 confusion matrix .

DATASET: link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The dataset have been splitted into 2 parts that are test.csv and train.csv .
The training set is used to build our machine learning models. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 
The test set is used to see how well our model performs on unseen data.


LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

RESULT:
the result is in the titanic.csv file
